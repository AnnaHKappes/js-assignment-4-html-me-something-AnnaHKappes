      <h1>My Journey To Be A JavaScript Coder</h1>

      <main>
         <P>With a little background of taking a class of Visual Basic language in college back in 2005, JavaScript is my fresh start to learn a new programming language. It was not easy, yet interesting and exciting journey. So far, I have learned so much, beyond my initial expectations, and I am so proud of myself.</P>

            <h2>The Process Of Learning </h2>
            <P>There were times I felt frustrated when I could not figure out why my codes not running. It took lots of time to figure out that missing curling bracket or my misspelling. There were also times I felt unconfident when I read the whole chapter and thought I understood it, however, I still had difficult on doing exercises and studios. Through the journey, besides learning JavaScript, I think I am learning how to handle my frustration, calm myself and ride up. When a problem is solved by me, the moments of joy and confidence is very awarding, making the whole problem-solving journey worthy.</P>

            <h2>Projects I Have Worked On</h2>

            <P>At the beginning of starting LaunchCode course, my initial motivation is to land a job in IT, till today, my motivation is still the same. I love learning coding language and applying it in real life projects. I enjoy the sense of accomplishments.</P>
